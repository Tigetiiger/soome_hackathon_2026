# compactor_sim — synthetic hourly data for waste compactors

Europress × Since AI Hackathon 2026 (Turku). Generates hourly telemetry and ground
truth for a fleet of press containers (cardboard, paper, plastic film, mixed household waste)
to train a **hydraulic soft sensor**: estimate the mass inside the container every
hour from signals the machine already has (fill, press count, ram pressure) plus
weather, so customers can check the weighbridge figure.

**All data is invented. Nothing represents real Europress data or real Europress
pressure settings.**

The soft-sensor training/prediction pipeline that uses this data lives in
[`weight_train/`](weight_train/README.md); results are in `models/<run>/REPORT.md`.

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# simulate (400 bins x 365 days ~ 30 s, ~3.5 M hourly rows; 25 bins ~ 8 s)
.venv/bin/python -m compactor_sim --config config.yaml --bins 400 --days 365 --seed 7 --out runs/full400
.venv/bin/python -m compactor_sim --bins 25 --days 365 --out runs/bins25

.venv/bin/python validate.py runs/full400     # sanity report + plots in runs/full400/plots/
.venv/bin/python baseline.py runs/full400     # LightGBM: fill-only vs +pressure vs +rain (~1 min)
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q                 # 18 tests, ~6 s
```

CLI flags override `run.*` in the config: `--bins`, `--days`, `--seed`, `--out`,
`--no-strokes`. The same seed gives bit-identical output (tested).

### Replaying real FMI weather
Set `weather.mode: fmi_csv` and `weather.fmi_csv.path`. The CSV needs one row per
region and date covering the simulated span (including the 28-day burn-in):

```
region,date,temp_mean_c,precip_mm,rh_pct
UUS,2025-09-03,14.2,0.0,71
```
`rh_pct` is optional (synthesised if absent). Column names can be remapped in
`weather.fmi_csv.columns`. Download FMI daily observations for one station per region
(for example Helsinki-Vantaa, Turku, Tampere-Pirkkala, Oulu, Rovaniemi) and rename
their columns. Hourly disaggregation, snow and snowpack work exactly as in synthetic mode.

## Machine behaviour from the expert interview

What a Europress specialist told us, and how the simulator models it:

| expert said | simulator |
|---|---|
| fill is estimated **only from pressure**, as a rolling average over ~10 cycles, because single strokes spike (a box crushed on the way in) | `sensors.fill_mode: pressure_derived`: 10-stroke exponential rolling average of back pressure → linear fill; per-stroke spikes in `hydraulics.spikes` |
| the ram enters only **20–30 cm** into the container | pressure graph: rise only in the last ~20–35 % of the stroke (`hydraulics.curve.ram_ingress_frac`) |
| back pressure is visible from **5–10 % fill**, then it packs until full | `hydraulics.fill_onset: 0.07`, linear rise |
| fill accuracy about **5 %** | per-installation setpoint calibration → ≈ 6 pp mean error |
| fill tells **volume; what it says about weight is a question mark** | pressure depends only moderately on pack density (`density_exponent: 1.0`); corr(peak pressure, density) at high fill is weak |
| cardboard and plastic pack densely; **mixed household waste** is heavy and less condensed | material `mixed_waste` (400 kg/m³, compressibility 0.12) replaces mixed plastic |
| the machine can log the **pressure graph** | `pressure_curves.parquet` + hourly `curve_*` features |

## Output (one folder per run)

| file | content |
|---|---|
| `hourly.parquet` | one row per machine-hour (bin-major order), columns below |
| `bins.parquet` | machine and site attributes, including hidden truth (`density_factor`, `fill_gain_bias`, `pressure_gain_*`, `relief_bar`, `p_idle_bar`, `daily_input_kg`, …) |
| `weather_daily.parquet` | region, date, temp_mean/min/max_c, precip_mm, rain_mm, snow_mm, rh_pct, snow_swe_mm. **Includes the 28 burn-in days** before `start`, so 7-day lags exist from day 1 |
| `lifts.parquet` | one row per lift: order and lift time, trigger (`fill`/`max_interval`), `false_full_trigger` (bridging active at the order **and** the reading without bridging would have stayed below the threshold), observed/true fill at order, true removed mass split into base / humidity / carried / hopper / free water / ice, `true_moisture_extra`, DUO residue, days since last lift, `weighbridge_net_kg` (±15 kg, 20 kg steps), tare, gross load |
| `strokes.parquet` | one row per ram stroke: ts, oil temp, true and measured peak pressure, duration, energy |
| `pressure_curves.parquet` | raw pressure graphs (16 points along the ram stroke) for the first 5 machines: bin_id, ts, stroke_in_hour, ram_position, pressure_bar |
| `config_used.yaml`, `summary.json` | exact config, plus counts, lift means and the mass-balance ledger |

`hourly.parquet` columns:

| column | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| bin_id, ts | str, timestamp[ns, Europe/Helsinki] | machine id, local hour start |
| material, equipment_class, container_volume_m3, region, infeed, drainage | | static attributes |
| rh_pct, temp_c, precip_mm_day | float | day mean RH, hourly air temperature, day total precipitation |
| fill_pct | float | **firmware fill estimate derived from ram pressure** (default `sensors.fill_mode: pressure_derived`): approximate, biased by pack density, 0 below ~30 % fill, held between strokes; plus spurious-high episodes and NaN on dropout. `fill_mode: ultrasonic` gives a direct level sensor instead |
| presses | int | strokes this hour (exact) |
| peak_pressure_bar | float | max stroke peak this hour (NaN if no stroke or dropout) |
| lift_event | int8 | 1 = container emptied at the **start** of this hour (set from the lift itself, also when nothing was lifted) |
| true_mass_kg | float | mass in the machine at hour end (container + press chamber) |
| true_fill_pct, true_density_kg_m3, true_moisture_extra | float | truth |
| oil_temp_c, energy_kwh, precip_mm, snow_mm_day | float | extra signals |
| ref_scale_kg | float | load-cell reading (true × (1 ± 0.5 %)) on ~5 % of machines, else NaN |
| lifted_mass_kg, side_waste_kg | float | truth: mass removed by the lift / left outside this hour |
| true_water_humidity_kg, true_water_carried_kg, true_water_hopper_kg, true_free_water_kg, true_ice_kg | float | water in the container by pathway (humidity can be < 0: drier than reference) |
| true_false_full | bool | a spurious-high episode (jam / bridging) is distorting the fill reading |
| curve_contact_pos, curve_rise_slope_bar, curve_mean_bar, curve_completion | float | **pressure graph** features, hourly mean over strokes: ram position where pressure starts rising (pack face, i.e. geometric fill), rise slope to the peak (density/stiffness), mean pressure over the stroke (∝ work), share of travel before the relief valve opened |

**Lift timing convention:** the lift happens at the start of the `lift_event` hour.
That row's `true_mass_kg` is after the lift. The row one hour earlier holds the mass
that was lifted (`lifted_mass_kg` equals that mass, up to the DUO residue).

Code layout (`compactor_sim/`): `config`, `timeline` (DST-safe local clock, Finnish
holidays, truck hours), `fleet`, `weather`, `inflow`, `moisture`, `physics` (pure laws),
`sensors`, `container` (the only stateful part), `operations`, `strokes`, `simulate`,
`output`, `cli`.

Everything that does not depend on container state (weather, inflow, noise, sensor
error, oil temperature) is drawn up front as (hour × bin) arrays. Each random component
has its own seeded stream (`numpy.random.SeedSequence.spawn`). A 28-day burn-in
(random initial fill) desynchronises the fleet before the reported period starts.

### Container physics
* **Layers**: one per loading day since the last lift. Each stores base mass, water by
  pathway, reference volume `vref`, frost volume and the highest pack pressure it
  has experienced, `pmax`.
* **Density law**: `rho = rho_typ · machine_factor · daily_factor · (1 + 0.6·moisture_extra) · g(pmax)`,
  with `g(P) = (1 + c·ln(1 + P/P0)) / (1 + c·ln(1 + P_ref/P0))`. So `rho_typ` is the
  density at the reference pack pressure. Compaction is plastic: a layer only gets
  denser.
* **Springback**: right after a stroke the pack sits `springback` (2–8 %) denser and
  relaxes back over about 3 h, so the fill reading creeps up after pressing.
* **Fill** = Σ layer volume / container volume. Material that does not fit becomes side
  waste. The volume estimate for new material is an upper bound, so true fill never
  exceeds 100 %.
* **Press chamber**: loads in an hour without a stroke (about 15 % of events) wait in
  the chamber and go in with the next stroke. Hopper rain and snow also enter with
  the next stroke.
* **Water routing**: liquid water reaching the pack is soaked up (fibre 30 %, plastics
  10 %). The rest drains (drainage option), seeps slowly (standard container,
  τ = 120 h) or pools (waterproof set-up). Free water adds mass, not volume. Below
  0 °C free water and hopper snow become ice (no drainage) and melt later at
  2 %/h/°C. Wet loads entering below 0 °C form frozen lumps (+8–15 % volume) that
  thaw over about 12 h.
* **Lift**: COMBI empties fully. DUO keeps a residue of 0–2 % of the layers. The final
  press before the swap also takes the chamber contents.
* **Mass balance** (per bin, reported period): `start + material_in + hopper_precip − drained − seeped − side_waste − lifted = end`.
  Closes to about 1e-9 kg (tested).

### Hydraulics
`P_peak = min(relief, visc(T_oil) · (P_idle + k · f(fill) · stiffness · (rho/rho_typ)^1.0 · softening(moisture) · (1 + 1.5·frost_share)))`
with `f(fill) = clip((fill − 0.07)/0.93, 0, 1)` (back pressure from ~7 % fill, rising linearly) and density exponent 1.0. The pack only receives the part of
the pressure left after viscous losses (`relief/visc − P_idle`), so density growth
stalls when the valve opens. Wet fibre is softer (softening 1 − 2.5·moisture): a wet
pack is heavier at the same pressure, which is why weather adds information beyond
pressure. Per stroke, oil warms by 0.8 °C, so the first morning strokes are cold and
read high. The transducer adds 4 bar noise, a gain drift of about 2 %/yr and 0.5 bar
quantisation.

## Validation results (seed 7, 400 bins, 365 days; `validate.py`)

Physics after the expert interview (pressure-derived fill, medium density link, mixed waste).

| check | result | target |
|---|---|---|
| mass balance residual | 2.3e-9 kg max | 0 |
| lift mass cardboard / paper / film / mixed waste | 3.04 / 3.39 / 1.84 / 4.86 t | 2–3.5 / 2.5–4 / 1.2–2.2 / 3–6 t (mixed waste assumed) |
| heaviest net lift | **11.7 t** (34 of 20,281 lifts > 10 t, all mixed waste in 20 m³ DUO) | < ~10 t |
| days between lifts | median 7.0, 98 % within 2–14 d | mostly 2–14 |
| overflow | side waste 2.6 % of inflow; 18 % of lifts with some side waste | exception, not the rule |
| fill reading (pressure-derived) | corr 0.95 with true fill; ≈ 6 pp mean error | ~5 % (expert) |
| pressure graph | corr(contact point, true fill) −0.34 (ram enters only 20–30 cm) | — |
| annual precipitation UUS/VAR/PIR/POP/LAP | 724 / 723 / 601 / 526 / **359** mm (30-seed mean 659/676/625/521/507) | 600–700 S, 450–550 N |
| Jan / Jul mean T | UUS −3.9 / 18.4 °C, LAP −12.7 / 15.1 °C | −4 / 17 S, −12 / 15 N |
| cardboard lift mass, wet+humid vs dry week | open hopper +4.4 %, lidded +2.9 %, indoor shaft −1.4 % | a few %, open > shaft |
| peak pressure at true fill ≥ 85 % | p10 140, p50 182, p90 234 bar | typical 150–220, cap ~240 |
| corr(peak pressure, density) at fill ≥ 85 % | 0.73 (cardboard) – 0.87 (film), across machines | weaker than before (medium link) |
| false-full-triggered lifts | 10.2 % (mean true fill 52 %, 1.68 t vs 3.13 t) | — |

Outside target:
* **Heaviest lift 11.7 t**: mixed waste at 400 kg/m³ in a 20 m³ DUO occasionally exceeds a
  hook-lift truck's ~10 t. Restricting mixed waste to ≤ 14 m³ containers (or ≤ 17 m³) would fix it.
* **Precipitation for seed 7**: one synthetic year with realistic interannual variability; the
  generator is unbiased over seeds.

## Baseline soft sensor (`baseline.py`)

Quick LightGBM check (5-fold CV grouped by machine, lifts ≥ 200 kg). The full pipeline with both
splits, intervals and the pressure graph is `weight_train/` (results in `models/full400/REPORT.md`).

| features | mean % err | median | p90 | WAPE |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| fill only | 23.3 | 15.1 | 40.2 | 19.0 |
| + pressure | 7.2 | 5.8 | 14.6 | 7.1 |
| + pressure + presses | 5.2 | 4.1 | 10.8 | 5.2 |
| + rain + RH (7 d) | 5.2 | 4.1 | 10.7 | 5.1 |

With the fill reading itself derived from pressure, fill alone is a weak predictor of weight
(23 %). Peak pressure and the number of presses since the last lift carry most of the information;
weather adds almost nothing measurable.

## Limitations
* Weather is regional (5 points). There is no microclimate, wind-driven rain, roof
  overhangs or hopper canopy.
* The pressure law is phenomenological and **its parameters are not real Europress
  values**. There is no position or stroke-length signal, no partial strokes, and no
  pack friction along the container.
* All layers share the pack pressure of each stroke. There is no pressure gradient
  front-to-back and no material creep beyond springback.
* Each machine is its own site. Co-located machines and shared staff behaviour are not
  modelled. Side waste leaves the system instead of being reloaded after the lift.
* Hygroscopic moisture is fixed at loading. The closed container does not exchange
  moisture afterwards, and pooled water does not soak into the bottom layers.
* Truck logistics are simple (independent random delay, no route capacity). Lifts during
  telemetry outages still happen. Orders use only valid readings.
* Overflow is reduced but not gone. Fast sites still overfill before the truck arrives:
  side waste is 3.0 % of inflow, 20 % of lifts had some side waste since the previous
  lift, and 13 % of lifts found the container at ≥ 99 % true fill.
* The fill ceiling differs slightly by material. Right after a stroke the pack is
  compressed by the springback and relaxes over about 3 h, so the reported true fill of a
  completely full container is about 100·(1 − 0.85·springback): ~96.6 % cardboard,
  98.3 % paper, 93.2 % film, 98.3 % mixed waste.
* With the defaults (3–10 days to threshold) no site is slow enough to hit the 28-day
  max interval. Raise `target_cycle_days.max` (for example to 30) to get scheduled
  lifts of part-full containers.
