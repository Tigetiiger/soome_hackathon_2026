"""Figure descriptions and the collapsible "All figures" gallery at the top of the page.

DESCRIPTIONS maps an image stem to a function that writes 2-4 sentences (what the graph shows, how to read it, the
key takeaway) from the build inputs: metrics.json, material_curve_<material>.json, summary.json, the simulator
configuration and the validation report. The same text is the long caption of the figure in the body. A stem without
an entry, or whose inputs are missing, gets a generic text built from its caption (recorded in FALLBACKS).
